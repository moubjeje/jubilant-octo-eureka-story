John is quite a character who lives in a setting.

John just wants to be left alone. But every where he goes cable salesman and door to door charlatans would always find John.
So John moved to the middle of the woods like Ron Swanson running away from his problems

John had only lived off the grid before he found Ron Swanson among the bush leaves with a shotgun and camo flap cap
as he scrounged for huckleberries. A day later they stumbled upon Calvin and Hobbes hauling their toboggan on their
way to the Yukon. And every day after, they met some other soul in denial: Simba, Jean-Valjean, Romeo and Juliet,
Elsa, the entire UK... they were all there. And Shrek was there to take them all in. 

After having a conversation with the characters, John decided to make a team to combat the charlatans. First of all, 
they recognized that they should raise their mental power. To increase the power of spirit, they did meditation all day.
Secondly, even though some of them are already powerful enough to combat charlatans, the ultimate goal of the team is 
overcoming all hardships of all team members. As a result, they practiced physical hardships altogether.

The end.
